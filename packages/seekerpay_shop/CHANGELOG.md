# Changelog

## 1.0.5

- **UI**: Shop config tiles (`ShopLlmSettings`, `ClaudeVisionSettings`) — replaced yellow accent with white, transparent card backgrounds, consistent input fills and switch colors for dark purple shop mode theme.

## 1.0.4

- **Product Catalog Arweave Sync**:
  - `ArweaveOrderService.saveProduct()` — encrypts and uploads products to Arweave with `Type=product_catalog` tag.
  - `ArweaveOrderService.restoreProducts()` — decrypts all catalog records; deduplicates by barcode keeping the latest `savedAt` version.
  - `ArweaveOrderService.syncProducts()` — pull-only sync; merges remote products missing locally and fills in `ownerPriceUsd` from Arweave where local has none.
  - `ArweaveOrderClient.queryProducts()` — new GraphQL query targeting `Type=product_catalog` (refactored shared `_query()` helper).
  - `ArweaveProductSyncResult` model for product sync results.
- **`ownerPriceUsd` priority in scanning**:
  - `ProductScanSheet` now pre-fills price with `ownerPriceUsd` (merchant's set price) instead of `lastPriceUsd` when a local catalog match is found.
- **`HistoryNotifier` improvements**:
  - `updateProduct()` / `saveOrder()` / `deleteProduct()` now keep `ProductCatalogService` (SharedPreferences) in sync so barcode lookup always sees the latest `ownerPriceUsd`.
  - `updateProduct()` triggers an async Arweave backup immediately after save.
  - `startBackgroundSync()` now pulls the product catalog from Arweave alongside orders.
- **Order cart**:
  - Manual item entry (`ADD ITEM MANUALLY` button) — type name + price without scanning.
  - Order-level discount — flat `$` or `%` discount with live preview; stored as `discountUsd` on `Order`; backward-compatible JSON.
  - `setDiscount()` added to `OrderNotifier`.
  - Dialog overflow fixed for keyboard-up state (`insetPadding` + `SingleChildScrollView`).
- **Payment tolerance**:
  - Overpayment auto-accepts; underpayment shows orange `PARTIAL PAYMENT` banner with remaining SKR; QR updates to remaining amount.

## 1.0.3

- **Arweave/Irys Sync Fixes**:
  - Corrected Ed25519 signature implementation for Solana (Irys requires hex-encoded ASCII signing of the deepHash).
  - Standardized `deepHash` implementation to Arweave 2.0 specs.
  - Implemented multi-node GraphQL failover (node1, node2, uploader, arweave.net).
  - Increased query timeouts to 90s and added retry logic to handle network lag.
- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Redesigned configuration alerts with a modern dark theme and context-aware icons.
  - Added a 'CONFIGURE' button to jump directly to shop settings.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Added `go_router` for improved navigation handling.
