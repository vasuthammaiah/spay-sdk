P2P payment handoff for the SeekerPay SDK using Google Nearby Connections. Enables two Seeker devices to exchange Solana Pay URLs over Bluetooth / Wi-Fi without internet connectivity.

---

## Features

- **Advertise** — Broadcast a Solana Pay payment URL to nearby devices.
- **Discover** — Scan for nearby SeekerPay advertisers and list them in real time.
- **Connect & receive** — Connect to a discovered device and automatically receive its Solana Pay URL.
- **Auto-stop** — The session stops itself as soon as a valid `solana:` URL is received.
- **Permission handling** — Built-in `checkPermissions()` and `askPermissions()` helpers for Bluetooth and location grants.
- **Riverpod state** — Full reactive `NearbyState` with status, device list, errors, and received URL.

## Usage

### Advertise a payment request (sender side)

```dart
import 'package:seekerpay_bluetooth/seekerpay_bluetooth.dart';
import 'package:seekerpay_qr/seekerpay_qr.dart';
import 'package:seekerpay_core/seekerpay_core.dart';

final nearby = ref.read(nearbyServiceProvider.notifier);

// 1. Request permissions
final granted = await nearby.checkPermissions();
if (!granted) {
  await nearby.askPermissions();
  return;
}

// 2. Build the Solana Pay URL
final url = SolanaPayUrl(
  recipient: myWalletAddress,
  amount: BigInt.from(2_000_000), // 2.00 SKR
  splToken: SKRToken.mintAddress,
).encode();

// 3. Start advertising — other devices will discover this device
await nearby.startAdvertising('Alice', url);
```

### Discover and connect (recipient side)

```dart
final nearby = ref.read(nearbyServiceProvider.notifier);
await nearby.checkPermissions();

// Start discovery — NearbyState.discoveredDevices updates reactively
await nearby.startDiscovery('Bob');

// Watch discovered devices
final state = ref.watch(nearbyServiceProvider);
for (final device in state.discoveredDevices) {
  print('Found: ${device.name} (${device.id})');
}

// Connect to a specific device
await nearby.connectToDevice(device.id, 'Bob');

// The received Solana Pay URL appears in state.receivedUrl
ref.listen<NearbyState>(nearbyServiceProvider, (_, state) {
  if (state.receivedUrl != null) {
    final payRequest = SolanaPayUrl.decode(state.receivedUrl!);
    // Proceed with payment...
  }
});
```

### Stop all sessions

```dart
nearby.stopAll();
```
